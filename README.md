# nature

A simple genetic algorithms library for Clojure.

## Usage

A deployed copy of the most recent version of [nature exists on clojars.](https://clojars.org/nature)
To use it, add the following as a dependency in your project.clj file:

```
[nature "0.0.1"]
```

The next time you build your application, [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) should pull it automatically.

Alternatively, you may clone or fork the repository to work with it directly.
