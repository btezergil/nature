> Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?
> Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet's ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that's found his dad's gun.

## Installation

A deployed copy of the most recent version of [nature exists on clojars.](https://clojars.org/nature)
To use it, add the following as a dependency in your project.clj file:

```
[nature "0.0.1"]
```

The next time you build your application, [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) should pull it automatically.
Alternatively, you may clone or fork the repository to work with it directly.

## Usage

The core of nature's functionality lies within the `evolve` function, and we'll walkthrough a very simple example here.
